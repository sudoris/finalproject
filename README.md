A text based game implemented with C++. 

The player must make it through to the head of the train (a linked list structure is used to represent the train). Each room of the train has an item to be found or puzzle to be answered before the player can continue on to the next room. The player starts with 100 energy and each move takes 5 energy. Giving the wrong answer to a puzzle or activating traps can also reduce the player's health.
